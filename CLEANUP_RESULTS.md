## 🚀 Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Run tests** to ensure nothing broke:
   ```bash
   php artisan test
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Clear caches** for fresh start:

   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

3. **Commit the cleanup**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: major project cleanup - removed temp files and organized structure"
   ```
