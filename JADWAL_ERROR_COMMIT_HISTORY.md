The "Objects are not valid as a React child" error was introduced in commit **3519dc9b1** on August 2, 2025.

## Key Commits

### Working Commit (Before Error)
**Commit**: `72e54cebb`  
**Date**: Sat Aug 2 20:22:31 2025  
**Title**: feat: enhance dokter dashboard with advanced metrics and medical mission scheduling

### Error-Introducing Commit
**Commit**: `3519dc9b1`  
**Date**: Sat Aug 2 22:38:51 2025  
**Title**: feat: implement medical mission jadwal interface and attendance features
- This is where the error first appeared
- Added jadwal jaga API endpoints that returned raw database objects
- Modified JadwalJaga component with new backend data handling

## To Revert to Working State

If you want to go back to the working version:

```bash
# Option 1: Checkout the specific file from the working commit
git checkout 72e54cebb -- resources/js/components/dokter/JadwalJaga.tsx

# Option 2: Revert the entire commit that introduced the error
git revert 3519dc9b1

# Option 3: Reset to the working commit (WARNING: this will lose all commits after)
git reset --hard 72e54cebb
```

## Current Fix Applied
Instead of reverting, we implemented a creative solution:
1. Created a new SimpleJadwalJaga.tsx component with safe data handling
2. Replaced the complex JadwalJaga.tsx with a simple export
3. This ensures no raw database objects are ever rendered

## Timeline
- **Before Aug 2, 20:22**: JadwalJaga working correctly
- **Aug 2, 20:22**: Last known working state (commit 72e54cebb)
- **Aug 2, 22:38**: Error introduced (commit 3519dc9b1)
