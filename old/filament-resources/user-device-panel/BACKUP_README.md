# UserDevice Admin Panel Backup

**Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Reason**: Remove user-devices feature from admin panel (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/user-devices)

## Files Moved to Backup:
- `UserDeviceResource.php` - Main Filament resource
- `UserDeviceResource/` folder - All pages (List, Create, Edit, View)
- `DeviceManagementStatsWidget.php` - Widget for device statistics

## What Was NOT Removed (Critical Dependencies):
- `app/Models/UserDevice.php` - **KEPT** (used by Attendance, UserSession, RefreshToken, BiometricTemplate)
- Database migrations - **KEPT** (required for system functionality)
- API controllers - **KEPT** (mobile app functionality)
- Authentication services - **KEPT** (device binding, biometric auth)

## Changed Files:
- `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php:80` - Commented out UserDeviceResource registration

## To Restore:
1. Move files back from this backup folder
2. Uncomment the UserDeviceResource line in AdminPanelProvider.php
3. Clear Filament caches: `php artisan filament:clear-cached-components`

## Impact:
- ✅ Admin panel no longer shows user-devices menu
- ✅ Route /admin/user-devices is no longer accessible  
- ✅ All core functionality (auth, attendance, API) remains intact
- ✅ Database relationships preserved
- ✅ Mobile app functionality unaffected
