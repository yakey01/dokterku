## üß™ Testing

### CLI Testing Command

**Command**: `php artisan work-location:test-deletion [location_id]`

**Features**:
- Interactive deletion testing

- Actual deletion testing (optional)
- Detailed result reporting

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Test deletion for specific location

php artisan work-location:test-deletion
```

## üìä Configuration Options

### Service Options

```php
$options = [
    'force_delete' => false,           // Hard delete instead of soft delete
    'reassign_users' => true,          // Automatically reassign users
    'preserve_history' => true,        // Keep historical records
    'notify_users' => true,            // Send notifications (future)

   - **Solution**: Clear all cache or use the service's cache clearing methods

4. **Performance Issues with Large Datasets**
   - **Solution**: Use bulk operations with pagination

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check work location table structure
php artisan tinker --execute="use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema; dump(Schema::getColumnListing('work_locations'));"

# Test deletion service directly
php artisan work-location:test-deletion

# Clear all caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear
