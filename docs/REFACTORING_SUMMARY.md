# Refactoring Summary

## Date: 2025-07-15

### Overview
Comprehensive codebase refactoring following clean architecture principles and world-class standards as requested.

### Controller Organization
Controllers have been reorganized into domain-specific folders:

#### Before:
```
app/Http/Controllers/
├── Api/
├── Admin/
├── DokterGigi/
├── Manager/
├── Staff/
├── Treasurer/
└── NonParamedis/
```

#### After:
```
app/Http/Controllers/
├── Admin/          # Admin functionality
├── Auth/           # Authentication
├── Bendahara/      # Treasurer functionality
├── Dokter/         # Doctor functionality
├── Jaspel/         # Service fee management
├── Manajer/        # Manager functionality
├── Master/         # Master data management
├── NonParamedis/   # Non-paramedis functionality
├── Paramedis/      # Paramedis functionality
├── Petugas/        # Staff functionality
├── Settings/       # System settings
└── Transaksi/      # Transaction management
```

### Files Moved to old-files/
- `dokter-old-bootstrap/` - Old bootstrap-based dokter views
- `AuthenticatedSessionController.php.backup` - Backup auth controller
- React demo views (react-dashboard-standalone, premium-paramedis-dashboard, etc.)
- Old dashboard backup files

### Documentation Organization
All documentation has been moved to the `docs/` folder:
- Main documentation files (CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, etc.)
- View-specific documentation from subdirectories
- Architecture and API documentation

### Route Updates
All routes have been updated to reflect new controller namespaces:
- `web.php` - Updated controller references for Bendahara, Petugas, Dokter
- `api.php` - Updated Paramedis controller references

### Non-Paramedis Dashboard Status
✅ The non-paramedis dashboard is already using the new mobile app version with:
- World-class mobile UI design
- GPS-based attendance functionality via Livewire component
- Clean component-based architecture
- Responsive design with sidebar navigation

### Verification Results
- ✅ All routes are functional
- ✅ Non-paramedis routes verified: dashboard, presensi, jadwal
- ✅ Controllers properly namespaced
- ✅ Views remain intact and functional
- ✅ GPS attendance system fully operational

### Clean Architecture Implementation
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Controllers organized by domain responsibility
2. **Consistent Naming**: All controllers follow domain-based naming patterns
3. **Clean Dependencies**: Updated all route definitions and imports
4. **Documentation**: Centralized all docs in dedicated folder
5. **Legacy Code**: Moved unused/old code to old-files for future reference

### Next Steps
The codebase is now organized following clean architecture principles with:
- Clear domain boundaries
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper file organization
- Functional non-paramedis attendance system with GPS
