# Soft Delete Fix Report - Bita Accounts

## Issue Summary
The attendance recap was showing data from soft-deleted users, specifically showing "bita" with 11.11% attendance when that user was actually deleted. Only one active "bita" account remains but wasn't showing in the recap.

## Root Cause
The `AttendanceRecap` model queries were not filtering out soft-deleted users and pegawai records, causing deleted users' attendance data to appear in reports.

## Users Named "Bita" Status

### Soft Deleted Users (Should NOT appear in reports):
1. **bita (ID: 20)** - DELETED on 2025-07-25
   - Had 4 attendance records (11.11%)
   - Was incorrectly showing in recap

2. **Bita Paramedis (ID: 21)** - DELETED on 2025-07-25
   - No attendance records

3. **bita (ID: 22)** - DELETED on 2025-07-25  
   - Non-Paramedis (Bendahara)
   - No pegawai record

4. **Sabita (ID: 26)** - DELETED on 2025-07-26
   - Had 1 attendance record (3.7%)
   - Was incorrectly showing in recap

### Active Users (Should appear if they have attendance):
1. **bita (ID: 28)** - ACTIVE
   - Not a Paramedis (no pegawai record)
   - Not eligible for Paramedis recap

2. **bita (ID: 30)** - ACTIVE
   - Paramedis type
   - 0 attendance records
   - Correctly NOT showing in recap (no attendance)

## Fix Applied

Updated `AttendanceRecap.php` model to filter out soft-deleted records in all three methods:

### 1. Paramedis Attendance Data
```php
->whereNull('u.deleted_at') // Filter out soft deleted users
->whereNull('p.deleted_at') // Filter out soft deleted pegawai
```

### 2. Doctor Attendance Data
```php
->whereNull('u.deleted_at') // Filter out soft deleted users
->whereNull('d.deleted_at') // Filter out soft deleted dokters
```

### 3. Non-Paramedis Attendance Data
```php
->whereNull('u.deleted_at') // Filter out soft deleted users
->whereNull('p.deleted_at') // Filter out soft deleted pegawai
```

## Results After Fix

✅ **Soft deleted users no longer appear in attendance recap**
- User ID 20 (bita) - No longer shows
- User ID 26 (Sabita) - No longer shows

✅ **Only active users appear in recap**
- Fitri Tri (ID: 25): 7.41%
- Perawat Suster (ID: 11): 3.7%
- Siti Rahayu, S.Kes (ID: 23): 3.7%

✅ **Active "bita" (ID: 30) correctly not showing**
- Has 0 attendance records
- Would appear if they check in

## Recommendations

1. **Archive Old Attendance Data**
   - 4 attendance records exist for deleted users
   - Consider archiving before permanent deletion

2. **Regular Cleanup**
   - Use `php artisan cleanup:soft-deleted` monthly
   - Removes records older than 30 days

3. **Prevent Username Confusion**
   - Multiple users named "bita" caused confusion
   - Consider enforcing unique display names

4. **Update Other Reports**
   - Check other reporting queries for similar issues
   - Ensure all queries filter soft-deleted records

## Testing
The fix has been tested and verified:
- Soft deleted users no longer appear in reports
- Active users with attendance show correctly
- Active users without attendance correctly excluded
- All attendance percentages calculate correctly

## Clean Up Commands
```bash
# Remove temporary test files
rm test_soft_delete_fix.php

# Run cleanup for old soft deleted records
php artisan cleanup:soft-deleted --dry-run
```
