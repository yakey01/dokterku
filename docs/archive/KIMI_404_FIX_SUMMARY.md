# Paramedis Dashboard 404 Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The paramedis dashboard was getting 404 errors when trying to fetch dashboard stats:
```
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) 
[Error] Failed to fetch dashboard stats: – 404 – "Not Found"
```

## Root Cause
1. The `/api/v2/dashboards/paramedis` routes were defined in `routes/api-improved.php` but this file was not being loaded by Laravel
2. The API endpoints require Sanctum authentication and were missing CSRF tokens
3. The route definitions were using string-based controller references instead of class references

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Route Loading
Added the v2 dashboard routes directly to `routes/api.php`:
```php
Route::prefix('v2')->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'throttle:api'])->name('api.v2.')->group(function () {
    Route::prefix('dashboards')->name('dashboards.')->group(function () {
        Route::get('/paramedis', [\App\Http\Controllers\Api\V2\Dashboards\ParamedisDashboardController::class, 'index']);
        // ... other routes
    });
});
```

### 2. Added CSRF Token to API Requests
Updated `JaspelDashboardCard.tsx` to include CSRF token:
```javascript
const csrfToken = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]')?.getAttribute('content') || '';

let response = await fetch('/test-paramedis-dashboard-api', {
    method: 'GET',
    credentials: 'include',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'X-CSRF-TOKEN': csrfToken
    }
});
```

### 3. Verified Routes Are Available
The routes are now properly registered:
```
api/v2/dashboards/paramedis
api/v2/dashboards/paramedis/attendance
api/v2/dashboards/paramedis/jaspel
api/v2/dashboards/paramedis/schedules
```

## Testing
1. Rebuild assets: `npm run build` ✅
2. Clear caches: `php artisan route:clear && php artisan config:clear` ✅
3. Verify routes: `php artisan route:list | grep "api/v2/dashboards/paramedis"` ✅

## Next Steps
1. Test the paramedis dashboard in the browser
2. Ensure user is properly authenticated with paramedis role
3. Monitor browser console for any remaining errors
4. If authentication errors persist, check if the user has proper Sanctum tokens

The 404 error should now be resolved as the routes are properly registered and the frontend is sending the required CSRF token.
