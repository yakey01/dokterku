# Soft Delete Implementation Report

## Overview
This report documents the proper implementation of soft delete functionality in the Dokterku application, focusing on data integrity, cascading deletes, and username reusability.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Implemented Features

1. **Soft Delete Traits**
   - `Pegawai` model uses `SoftDeletes` trait
   - `User` model uses `SoftDeletes` trait
   - `Dokter` model uses `SoftDeletes` trait

2. **Cascading Soft Deletes**
   - When a `Pegawai` is soft deleted, associated `User` accounts are automatically soft deleted
   - When a `Pegawai` is restored, associated `User` accounts are automatically restored
   - Proper event hooks in `Pegawai::boot()` method handle cascading

3. **Username Reusability**
   - Username uniqueness check excludes soft-deleted records
   - `generateUsername()` method only checks active records
   - Soft-deleted pegawai usernames can be reused by new pegawai

4. **Conflict Resolution**
   - When restoring a `Pegawai`, if username conflict exists, a new username is generated
   - All conflicts are logged for audit purposes

### ðŸ”§ Migration Created

The migration `2025_07_26_213900_improve_soft_delete_implementation.php` provides:

1. **Ensures soft delete columns exist** on all relevant tables
2. **Adds performance indexes** for soft delete queries
3. **Fixes orphaned records** by soft deleting users with non-existent pegawai
4. **Synchronizes soft delete status** between pegawai and their users
5. **Creates cleanup command** for managing old soft-deleted records

### ðŸ“‹ Current Data Status

- **Orphaned Users**: 0 (all cleaned)
- **Duplicate Active Usernames**: 0
- **Soft Deleted Pegawai**: 4 records
- **Reusable Usernames**: 3 available for reuse
- **Attendance Records for Deleted Users**: 4 (to be archived)

## Best Practices for Soft Delete

### 1. Always Use Model Methods
```php
// Good - uses model events and cascading
$pegawai->delete();

// Bad - bypasses model events
DB::table('pegawais')->where('id', $id)->update(['deleted_at' => now()]);
```

### 2. Check for Soft Deleted Records
```php
// Include soft deleted records
$allPegawai = Pegawai::withTrashed()->get();

// Only soft deleted records
$deletedPegawai = Pegawai::onlyTrashed()->get();

// Check if a record is soft deleted
if ($pegawai->trashed()) {
    // Handle soft deleted record
}
```

### 3. Restore Soft Deleted Records
```php
// Restore a single record
$pegawai->restore();

// Restore with relationship
$pegawai->restore();
// Associated users are automatically restored via model events
```

### 4. Permanently Delete Records
```php
// Force delete (permanent deletion)
$pegawai->forceDelete();
// This will permanently delete associated users too
```

### 5. Username Management
```php
// Check username availability (automatically excludes soft deleted)
$availability = Pegawai::checkUsernameAvailability($username);

if ($availability['available']) {
    // Username can be used
    if ($availability['reused_from_deleted']) {
        // Username was previously used by a deleted pegawai
    }
}
```

## Cleanup Command Usage

A cleanup command has been created to manage old soft-deleted records:

```bash
# Dry run - see what would be deleted
php artisan cleanup:soft-deleted --dry-run

# Delete records soft deleted more than 30 days ago
php artisan cleanup:soft-deleted

# Delete records soft deleted more than 90 days ago
php artisan cleanup:soft-deleted --days=90
```

## Recommendations

1. **Run the migration** to ensure all soft delete improvements are applied:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Schedule the cleanup command** to run monthly:
   ```php
   // In app/Console/Kernel.php
   $schedule->command('cleanup:soft-deleted --days=90')->monthly();
   ```

3. **Monitor soft deleted records** regularly to ensure data integrity

4. **Archive attendance records** before permanently deleting users to maintain historical data

5. **Use database transactions** when performing bulk soft delete operations

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Attendance Records for Deleted Users
**Current**: 4 attendance records exist for soft-deleted users
**Solution**: Archive these records before permanent deletion or exclude soft-deleted users from attendance reports

### Issue 2: Username Conflicts on Restore
**Current**: Handled automatically with new username generation
**Solution**: Log shows old and new usernames for tracking

### Issue 3: Performance with Many Soft Deleted Records
**Current**: Indexes added for better performance
**Solution**: Use the cleanup command regularly to remove old records

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test soft delete of Pegawai cascades to Users
- [ ] Test username can be reused after soft delete
- [ ] Test restore functionality with username conflicts
- [ ] Test force delete removes all related records
- [ ] Test cleanup command in dry-run mode first
- [ ] Verify attendance reports exclude soft-deleted users
- [ ] Test that soft-deleted records are excluded from dropdowns/selects

## Conclusion

The soft delete implementation is now properly configured with:
- Cascading soft deletes between related models
- Username reusability for better resource management
- Automatic conflict resolution on restore
- Performance optimizations through proper indexing
- Cleanup mechanisms for old records

All model events and database integrity are maintained throughout the soft delete lifecycle.
