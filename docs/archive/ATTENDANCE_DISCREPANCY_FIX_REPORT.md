# Attendance Discrepancy Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The Paramedis dashboard was showing "27 Tidak Hadir" (27 days absent) for all users, but some users like "bita" were not appearing in the attendance recap at all. This created a data consistency issue between the dashboard and the recap.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Dashboard Calculation Issue
The dashboard frontend was calculating absent days incorrectly:
- It was using `total_days` (count of attendance records) instead of actual working days
- For users with 0 attendance, `total_days = 0`, leading to incorrect calculation:
  ```javascript
  totalTidakHadir = total_days - on_time - late = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0
  ```

### 2. AttendanceRecap Query Issue
The AttendanceRecap model was using INNER JOIN with the attendances table:
- Users with 0 attendance records were excluded from results
- This made users like "bita" disappear from the recap entirely

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Enhancement (ParamedisDashboardController.php)
Added `working_days` field to the API response:
```php
// Calculate actual working days based on filter
$workingDays = 0;
switch ($filter) {
    case 'month':
    default:
        // Count working days in current month (Mon-Sat)
        $startOfMonth = Carbon::now()->startOfMonth();
        $endOfMonth = Carbon::now()->endOfMonth();
        $tempDate = $startOfMonth->copy();
        while ($tempDate->lte($endOfMonth)) {
            if ($tempDate->dayOfWeek !== Carbon::SUNDAY) {
                $workingDays++;
            }
            $tempDate->addDay();
        }
        break;
}

$attendanceStats = [
    'working_days' => $workingDays, // Added field
    // ... other fields
];
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (Laporan.tsx)
Updated calculation to use working_days:
```typescript
totalTidakHadir: attendanceStats.working_days ? 
    Math.max(0, attendanceStats.working_days - attendanceStats.on_time - attendanceStats.late) :
    Math.max(0, attendanceStats.total_days - attendanceStats.on_time - attendanceStats.late),
```

### 3. AttendanceRecap Model Fix
Changed from INNER JOIN to LEFT JOIN to include users with 0 attendance:
```php
->leftJoin('attendances as a', function($join) use ($startDate, $endDate) {
    $join->on('a.user_id', '=', 'u.id')
         ->whereBetween('a.date', [$startDate->format('Y-m-d'), $endDate->format('Y-m-d')]);
})
```

## Results

### Before Fix:
- **Dashboard**: Showed "0 Tidak Hadir" for users with no attendance
- **Recap**: Users with 0 attendance didn't appear at all

### After Fix:
- **Dashboard**: Correctly shows "27 Tidak Hadir" for users with 0 attendance
- **Recap**: All active Paramedis users appear, including those with 0% attendance

## Verification
For user "bita" (ID: 30):
- ✅ Dashboard now shows: 0 Hadir, 0 Terlambat, 27 Tidak Hadir
- ✅ Attendance Recap now shows: 0% attendance, Status: poor
- ✅ Data is consistent between dashboard and recap

## Additional Improvements Made
1. Soft delete filtering ensures deleted users don't appear
2. Working days calculation excludes Sundays (Mon-Sat only)
3. Backward compatibility maintained with fallback to old calculation

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Clean up test files
rm test_fixed_attendance.php

# Clear cache to ensure fresh data
php artisan cache:clear
```

## Impact
This fix ensures data consistency across the entire attendance system, providing accurate information for:
- Employee attendance tracking
- Performance evaluations
- Payroll calculations
- Management reporting
