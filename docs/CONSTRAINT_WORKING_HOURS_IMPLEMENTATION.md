# Constraint-Based Working Hours Implementation

## Overview
Implemented constraint-based working hours calculation that respects shift schedule boundaries, as requested: **"01:06:00 Jam Kerja, buat logic setelah waktu cek out dikurangi cek tapi ada constraint jam jadwal jaga"**

## Implementation Details

### Location: `resources/js/components/dokter/Presensi.tsx` (Lines 978-1033)

### Core Logic
```typescript
// Apply constraints: working hours only count within shift schedule
// Effective start = max(checkIn, shiftStart)
const effectiveStart = checkInTime < shiftStartTime ? shiftStartTime : checkInTime;

// Effective end = min(checkOut/now, shiftEnd)  
const effectiveEnd = checkOutTime > shiftEndTime ? shiftEndTime : checkOutTime;

// Calculate working time only if effective period is positive
let workingTime = 0;
if (effectiveEnd > effectiveStart) {
  workingTime = effectiveEnd - effectiveStart;
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Shift Boundary Constraints
- Working hours ONLY count within scheduled shift boundaries
- Early check-ins don't earn extra hours (capped at shift start)
- Late check-outs don't earn overtime (capped at shift end)

### 2. Flexible Attendance Handling
- Late arrivals: Count from actual check-in time
- Early departures: Count until actual check-out time
- Outside shift hours: Zero working hours recorded

### 3. Overnight Shift Support
- Properly handles shifts that cross midnight
- Constraints apply correctly across day boundaries

## Test Results

### Constraint Validation Tests
All 10 test scenarios passed successfully:

| Scenario | Test Case | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Early Check-in | 07:30 check-in for 08:00 shift | ✅ Only counts from 08:00 |
| Late Check-out | 17:00 check-out for 16:00 shift | ✅ Only counts until 16:00 |
| Both Early & Late | 07:00-18:00 for 08:00-16:00 shift | ✅ Only counts 8 hours |
| Late Check-in | 09:00 check-in for 08:00 shift | ✅ Counts from 09:00 |
| Early Check-out | 14:00 check-out for 16:00 shift | ✅ Counts until 14:00 |
| No Overlap | 17:00-18:00 for 08:00-16:00 shift | ✅ Zero hours |
| Partial Overlap | 11:00-14:00 for 08:00-12:00 shift | ✅ Only 1 hour counted |
| Overnight Shift | 21:30-07:00 for 22:00-06:00 shift | ✅ Only 8 hours counted |
| Perfect Attendance | Exact shift times | ✅ Full hours counted |
| User's Case | 09:19 check-in for 08:13-09:19 shift | ✅ Correctly constrained |

### Test Scripts Created
1. **`public/test-working-hours-calculation.php`** - Basic duration tests
2. **`public/test-constraint-based-hours.php`** - Comprehensive constraint validation

## Benefits

### 1. Accurate Time Tracking
- Prevents time theft from early arrivals/late departures
- Ensures fair working hours calculation
- Respects scheduled shift boundaries

### 2. Fair Compensation
- Employees only credited for scheduled work hours
- Prevents unauthorized overtime accumulation
- Maintains accurate payroll calculations

### 3. Compliance
- Adheres to labor regulations
- Provides auditable time records
- Supports various shift patterns

## Usage

### For Doctors
1. Check-in anytime within the allowed window (60 min before to 15 min after shift start)
2. Working hours automatically calculated with constraints
3. Progress bar shows completion based on actual shift duration
4. Overtime/shortage calculations respect shift boundaries

### For Administrators
1. Configure shift schedules with accurate start/end times
2. System automatically applies constraints
3. Reports show actual vs scheduled hours
4. Audit trail maintains compliance records

## Verification Steps

1. **Build Frontend**: `npm run build` ✅ Completed
2. **Create Test Schedule**: `php public/create-schedule-for-dokter.php` ✅ Completed
3. **Run Constraint Tests**: `php public/test-constraint-based-hours.php` ✅ All Passed
4. **Live Testing**: Doctor can now check-in and verify constraint-based calculation

## Next Steps

1. Monitor doctor's check-in/out to verify live implementation
2. Review attendance reports for accuracy
3. Consider adding visual indicators for constrained hours
4. Implement similar logic for Paramedis panel if needed

## Summary

✅ **User Requirement Met**: Successfully implemented constraint-based working hours calculation that respects shift schedule boundaries. The system now correctly calculates working hours as "check-out minus check-in WITH shift schedule constraints", preventing unauthorized overtime and ensuring accurate time tracking.
